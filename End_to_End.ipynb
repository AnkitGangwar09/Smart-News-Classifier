But just because he's currently atop the depth chart, and will stay there the rest of this season, Sanders isn't stationary or satisfied.,Coming off , of his young career, leading to coach Kevin Stefanski naming him the starter for the final four games, Sanders said before Wednesday\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s practice he's not concerned with whether he has shown Cleveland enough to end its long search for a franchise QB.,He's staying in the moment.,\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u0153That\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s not in my focus,\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u009d Sanders said. \\u00e2\\u20ac\\u0153My focus right now is the team we\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122re playing ahead, the Bears. So anything past that I\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122m not really focused on, honestly. I\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122m thankful for it, but I\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122m not content with my situation with everything.\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u009d,The former Colorado star has come a long way since tumbling to the fifth round of this year's draft. The 23-year-old was fourth string throughout training camp and the preseason before two trades and rookie Dillon Gabriel's concussion catapulted Sanders.,In just his third pro start on Sunday, Sanders threw three touchdown passes, ran for a score and finished with 364 yards against Tennessee. He joined Joe Burrow as the only rookie QBs in league history with at least 350 yards passing, three TDs and a rushing TD in a game.,The performance became a footnote as the Browns came up short , to the two-win Titans and their rookie QB, Cam Ward.,Following the game, Sanders caught up on the field with Ward, last year's No. 1 pick who pressed him on his plans for the upcoming offseason.,Unlike Ward, Sanders can't afford to think that far ahead.,\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u0153This is my life here. So we on two different spectrums right now,\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u009d Sanders said. \\u00e2\\u20ac\\u009dI got to focus on playing my best and being the best player I can for the team. And obviously the situations are different. I know he puts his all into these games and these final four games, but it\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s just a little bit different because you don\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122t know what could happen.,\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u0153I just go here, enjoy my day, work hard, do everything I can. If I\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122m here, I\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122m here. If I\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122m not, I\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122m not. It\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s nothing in my control. I try to control what I can control \\u00e2\\u20ac\\u201d going out there, making the right reads. Going out there, doing the right things, being the person I am and things will fall how they\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122re supposed to.\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u009d,Things rarely go as planned in Cleveland, but Sanders is giving the Browns some hope in another rotten season.,He's shown significant improvement each game, whether connecting on a downfield throw or firing the ball out of bounds to avoid a sack.,That's not to say he's been perfect.,In the third quarter last week, Sanders, who since college has had a bad habit of holding the ball too long, tried to create something out of nothing. It cost him.,Scrambling to buy time after the protection broke down, Sanders forced a pass down the middle that was easily intercepted by the Titans. The turnover set up Tennessee's go-ahead score and set the stage for the Titan's win.,It was another tough lesson for Sanders, who said changing his ways isn't problematic.,\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u0153Not hard. It just took a little explaining,\\\" he said, flashing a knowing smile. \\\"It\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s a negative thing to happen for me to just slow down. I look at everything and I understand, OK, this is what I was trying to do, and in this situation, this that\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s what you should do.,\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u0153And sometimes it go your way, then they\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122ll be like, \\u00e2\\u20ac\\u02dcthat was lit\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122 and sometimes it don\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122t. So you got to limit those that wasn\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122t the best risk in certain situations, certain times of the game.\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u009d,This week presents another tough test for Sanders, who will face a Chicago defense leading the league with 18 interceptions.,Stefanski, whose future could hinge on how the Browns play in December, has been pleased with his QB's steady progress.,\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u0153In terms of a light turning on, those type of things, I just think he\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s committed to getting better every single week,\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u009d he said. \\\"And that\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s what you want.\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u009d,Notes: The temperature could be in the single digits in Chicago. Sanders is doing all he can not to think about the icy weather. \\u00e2\\u20ac\\u0153One thing you don\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122t want to be is mentally defeated before you get there,\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u009d he said. \\u00e2\\u20ac\\u0153Whatever comes with however it feels out there just comes with it.\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u009d ... Several starters missed practice, including CB Denzel Ward , S Grant Delpit , DT Mason Graham , TE David Njoku and WR Cedric Tillman .

But just because he's currently atop the depth chart, and will stay there the rest of this season, Sanders isn't stationary or satisfied.,Coming off , of his young career, leading to coach Kevin Stefanski naming him the starter for the final four games, Sanders said before Wednesday\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s practice he's not concerned with whether he has shown Cleveland enough to end its long search for a franchise QB.,He's staying in the moment.,\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u0153That\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s not in my focus,\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u009d Sanders said. \\u00e2\\u20ac\\u0153My focus right now is the team we\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122re playing ahead, the Bears. So anything past that I\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122m not really focused on, honestly. I\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122m thankful for it, but I\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122m not content with my situation with everything.\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u009d,The former Colorado star has come a long way since tumbling to the fifth round of this year's draft. The 23-year-old was fourth string throughout training camp and the preseason before two trades and rookie Dillon Gabriel's concussion catapulted Sanders.,In just his third pro start on Sunday, Sanders threw three touchdown passes, ran for a score and finished with 364 yards against Tennessee. He joined Joe Burrow as the only rookie QBs in league history with at least 350 yards passing, three TDs and a rushing TD in a game.,The performance became a footnote as the Browns came up short , to the two-win Titans and their rookie QB, Cam Ward.,Following the game, Sanders caught up on the field with Ward, last year's No. 1 pick who pressed him on his plans for the upcoming offseason.,Unlike Ward, Sanders can't afford to think that far ahead.,\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u0153This is my life here. So we on two different spectrums right now,\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u009d Sanders said. \\u00e2\\u20ac\\u009dI got to focus on playing my best and being the best player I can for the team. And obviously the situations are different. I know he puts his all into these games and these final four games, but it\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s just a little bit different because you don\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122t know what could happen.,\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u0153I just go here, enjoy my day, work hard, do everything I can. If I\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122m here, I\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122m here. If I\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122m not, I\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122m not. It\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s nothing in my control. I try to control what I can control \\u00e2\\u20ac\\u201d going out there, making the right reads. Going out there, doing the right things, being the person I am and things will fall how they\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122re supposed to.\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u009d,Things rarely go as planned in Cleveland, but Sanders is giving the Browns some hope in another rotten season.,He's shown significant improvement each game, whether connecting on a downfield throw or firing the ball out of bounds to avoid a sack.,That's not to say he's been perfect.,In the third quarter last week, Sanders, who since college has had a bad habit of holding the ball too long, tried to create something out of nothing. It cost him.,Scrambling to buy time after the protection broke down, Sanders forced a pass down the middle that was easily intercepted by the Titans. The turnover set up Tennessee's go-ahead score and set the stage for the Titan's win.,It was another tough lesson for Sanders, who said changing his ways isn't problematic.,\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u0153Not hard. It just took a little explaining,\\\" he said, flashing a knowing smile. \\\"It\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s a negative thing to happen for me to just slow down. I look at everything and I understand, OK, this is what I was trying to do, and in this situation, this that\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s what you should do.,\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u0153And sometimes it go your way, then they\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122ll be like, \\u00e2\\u20ac\\u02dcthat was lit\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122 and sometimes it don\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122t. So you got to limit those that wasn\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122t the best risk in certain situations, certain times of the game.\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u009d,This week presents another tough test for Sanders, who will face a Chicago defense leading the league with 18 interceptions.,Stefanski, whose future could hinge on how the Browns play in December, has been pleased with his QB's steady progress.,\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u0153In terms of a light turning on, those type of things, I just think he\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s committed to getting better every single week,\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u009d he said. \\\"And that\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s what you want.\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u009d,Notes: The temperature could be in the single digits in Chicago. Sanders is doing all he can not to think about the icy weather. \\u00e2\\u20ac\\u0153One thing you don\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122t want to be is mentally defeated before you get there,\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u009d he said. \\u00e2\\u20ac\\u0153Whatever comes with however it feels out there just comes with it.\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u009d ... Several starters missed practice, including CB Denzel Ward , S Grant Delpit , DT Mason Graham , TE David Njoku and WR Cedric Tillman . Stefanski ruled out RG Wyatt Teller for Sunday.\",\n          \"Subscribe Now!

              "' Long before a  health condition  becomes obvious, the body often sends out quiet, easily overlooked signals that something isnâ€™t quite right.  While some warning signs are well known, others can seem unusual or unrelated at first glance - making them harder to recognise or connect to an underlying illness.   This is where awareness becomes powerful, especially when it comes to subtle changes in the hands and nails that can offer valuable clues about whatâ€™s happening inside the body. Also Read |  Delhi cardiologist with 40 years experience shares 5 warning signs your heart is struggling silently Dr Kunal Sood, an anaesthesiologist and interventional pain medicine physician, has highlighted five key changes in the nails and hands that may signal underlying health issues - and in some cases, chronic conditions such as  arthritis  or  psoriasis .  In an Instagram video shared on December 9, the physician explains that recognising these subtle signs early can aid in identifying serious health conditions and support timely diagnosis and treatment. A post shared by Kunal Sood, MD (@doctorsoood) According to Dr Kunal Sood, clubbing causes the fingertips to appear rounded with curved nails as the soft tissue enlarges - a physical change that can sometimes signal underlying lung or heart disease.  He explains, â€œIt occurs when megakaryocytes bypass the lungs and release growth factors like VEGF and PDGF at the fingertips.  It is linked to chronic lung disease (lung cancer, bronchiectasis, pulmonary fibrosis, cystic fibrosis) and heart conditions with long-term low oxygen such as cyanotic congenital heart disease or endocarditis. â€\\x9d Koilonychia or spoon-shaped nails might be an early warning sign of iron deficiency anaemia. Dr Sood highlights, â€œKoilonychia creates thin, concave nails due to impaired keratin formation when iron-dependent enzymes weaken. It often reflects iron deficiency from blood loss, heavy periods, low intake, malabsorption, or increased need in pregnancy. These nail changes can precede other symptoms for months.â€\\x9d If you notice red streaks on your nails, Dr Sood states that it might be an indication of blood vessel inflammation. He explains, â€œSplinter hemorrhages look like red-brown lines under the nails from ruptured capillaries.  While trauma is common, multiple streaks or those near the nail base raise concern for systemic conditions such as vasculitis, lupus, connective-tissue disease, or infective endocarditis. â€\\x9d Swollen joints on your fingers are a classic sign of arthritis. The physician points out, â€œSwelling may reflect  osteoarthritis  from cartilage loss or inflammatory arthritis like rheumatoid or psoriatic arthritis involving synovial inflammation. Because trauma, gout or metabolic issues can mimic this finding, clinical exam and imaging help distinguish causes.â€\\x9d According to Dr Sood, pitting in nails is a hallmark sign of nail-matrix involvement in psoriasis. He elaborates, â€œAbout one-third of  psoriasis  patients show pits, and prevalence increases with disease duration. It may accompany discoloration, thickening or onycholysis and is common in psoriatic arthritis, making it a useful early clue.â€\\x9d Note to readers: This article is for informational purposes only and not a substitute for professional medical advice.

But just because he's currently atop the depth chart, and will stay there the rest of this season, Sanders isn't stationary or satisfied.,Coming off , of his young career, leading to coach Kevin Stefanski naming him the starter for the final four games, Sanders said before Wednesday\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s practice he's not concerned with whether he has shown Cleveland enough to end its long search for a franchise QB.,He's staying in the moment.,\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u0153That\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s not in my focus,\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u009d Sanders said. \\u00e2\\u20ac\\u0153My focus right now is the team we\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122re playing ahead, the Bears. So anything past that I\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122m not really focused on, honestly. I\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122m thankful for it, but I\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122m not content with my situation with everything.\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u009d,The former Colorado star has come a long way since tumbling to the fifth round of this year's draft. The 23-year-old was fourth string throughout training camp and the preseason before two trades and rookie Dillon Gabriel's concussion catapulted Sanders.,In just his third pro start on Sunday, Sanders threw three touchdown passes, ran for a score and finished with 364 yards against Tennessee. He joined Joe Burrow as the only rookie QBs in league history with at least 350 yards passing, three TDs and a rushing TD in a game.,The performance became a footnote as the Browns came up short , to the two-win Titans and their rookie QB, Cam Ward.,Following the game, Sanders caught up on the field with Ward, last year's No. 1 pick who pressed him on his plans for the upcoming offseason.,Unlike Ward, Sanders can't afford to think that far ahead.,\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u0153This is my life here. So we on two different spectrums right now,\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u009d Sanders said. \\u00e2\\u20ac\\u009dI got to focus on playing my best and being the best player I can for the team. And obviously the situations are different. I know he puts his all into these games and these final four games, but it\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s just a little bit different because you don\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122t know what could happen.,\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u0153I just go here, enjoy my day, work hard, do everything I can. If I\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122m here, I\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122m here. If I\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122m not, I\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122m not. It\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s nothing in my control. I try to control what I can control \\u00e2\\u20ac\\u201d going out there, making the right reads. Going out there, doing the right things, being the person I am and things will fall how they\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122re supposed to.\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u009d,Things rarely go as planned in Cleveland, but Sanders is giving the Browns some hope in another rotten season.,He's shown significant improvement each game, whether connecting on a downfield throw or firing the ball out of bounds to avoid a sack.,That's not to say he's been perfect.,In the third quarter last week, Sanders, who since college has had a bad habit of holding the ball too long, tried to create something out of nothing. It cost him.,Scrambling to buy time after the protection broke down, Sanders forced a pass down the middle that was easily intercepted by the Titans. The turnover set up Tennessee's go-ahead score and set the stage for the Titan's win.,It was another tough lesson for Sanders, who said changing his ways isn't problematic.,\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u0153Not hard. It just took a little explaining,\\\" he said, flashing a knowing smile. \\\"It\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s a negative thing to happen for me to just slow down. I look at everything and I understand, OK, this is what I was trying to do, and in this situation, this that\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s what you should do.,\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u0153And sometimes it go your way, then they\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122ll be like, \\u00e2\\u20ac\\u02dcthat was lit\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122 and sometimes it don\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122t. So you got to limit those that wasn\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122t the best risk in certain situations, certain times of the game.\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u009d,This week presents another tough test for Sanders, who will face a Chicago defense leading the league with 18 interceptions.,Stefanski, whose future could hinge on how the Browns play in December, has been pleased with his QB's steady progress.,\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u0153In terms of a light turning on, those type of things, I just think he\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s committed to getting better every single week,\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u009d he said. \\\"And that\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s what you want.\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u009d,Notes: The temperature could be in the single digits in Chicago. Sanders is doing all he can not to think about the icy weather. \\u00e2\\u20ac\\u0153One thing you don\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122t want to be is mentally defeated before you get there,\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u009d he said. \\u00e2\\u20ac\\u0153Whatever comes with however it feels out there just comes with it.\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u009d ...

              "'Did you know your nails can signal psoriasis? Doctor shares 5 changes in hands and nails indicating underlying disease                Long before a  health condition  becomes obvious, the body often sends out quiet, easily overlooked signals that something isnâ€™t quite right.  While some warning signs are well known, others can seem unusual or unrelated at first glance - making them harder to recognise or connect to an underlying illness.   This is where awareness becomes powerful, especially when it comes to subtle changes in the hands and nails that can offer valuable clues about whatâ€™s happening inside the body. Also Read |  Delhi cardiologist with 40 years experience shares 5 warning signs your heart is struggling silently Dr Kunal Sood, an anaesthesiologist and interventional pain medicine physician, has highlighted five key changes in the nails and hands that may signal underlying health issues - and in some cases, chronic conditions such as  arthritis  or  psoriasis .  In an Instagram video shared on December 9, the physician explains that recognising these subtle signs early can aid in identifying serious health conditions and support timely diagnosis and treatment. A post shared by Kunal Sood, MD (@doctorsoood) According to Dr Kunal Sood, clubbing causes the fingertips to appear rounded with curved nails as the soft tissue enlarges - a physical change that can sometimes signal underlying lung or heart disease.  He explains, â€œIt occurs when megakaryocytes bypass the lungs and release growth factors like VEGF and PDGF at the fingertips.  It is linked to chronic lung disease (lung cancer, bronchiectasis, pulmonary fibrosis, cystic fibrosis) and heart conditions with long-term low oxygen such as cyanotic congenital heart disease or endocarditis. â€\\x9d Koilonychia or spoon-shaped nails might be an early warning sign of iron deficiency anaemia. Dr Sood highlights, â€œKoilonychia creates thin, concave nails due to impaired keratin formation when iron-dependent enzymes weaken. It often reflects iron deficiency from blood loss, heavy periods, low intake, malabsorption, or increased need in pregnancy. These nail changes can precede other symptoms for months.â€\\x9d If you notice red streaks on your nails, Dr Sood states that it might be an indication of blood vessel inflammation. He explains, â€œSplinter hemorrhages look like red-brown lines under the nails from ruptured capillaries.  While trauma is common, multiple streaks or those near the nail base raise concern for systemic conditions such as vasculitis, lupus, connective-tissue disease, or infective endocarditis. â€\\x9d Swollen joints on your fingers are a classic sign of arthritis. The physician points out, â€œSwelling may reflect  osteoarthritis  from cartilage loss or inflammatory arthritis like rheumatoid or psoriatic arthritis involving synovial inflammation. Because trauma, gout or metabolic issues can mimic this finding, clinical exam and imaging help distinguish causes.â€\\x9d According to Dr Sood, pitting in nails is a hallmark sign of nail-matrix involvement in psoriasis. He elaborates, â€œAbout one-third of  psoriasis  patients show pits, and prevalence increases with disease duration. It may accompany discoloration, thickening or onycholysis and is common in psoriatic arthritis, making it a useful early clue.â€\\x9d Note to readers: This article is for informational purposes only and not a substitute for professional medical advice.

But just because he's currently atop the depth chart, and will stay there the rest of this season, Sanders isn't stationary or satisfied.,Coming off , of his young career, leading to coach Kevin Stefanski naming him the starter for the final four games, Sanders said before Wednesday\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s practice he's not concerned with whether he has shown Cleveland enough to end its long search for a franchise QB.,He's staying in the moment.,\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u0153That\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s not in my focus,\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u009d Sanders said. \\u00e2\\u20ac\\u0153My focus right now is the team we\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122re playing ahead, the Bears. So anything past that I\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122m not really focused on, honestly. I\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122m thankful for it, but I\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122m not content with my situation with everything.\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u009d,The former Colorado star has come a long way since tumbling to the fifth round of this year's draft. The 23-year-old was fourth string throughout training camp and the preseason before two trades and rookie Dillon Gabriel's concussion catapulted Sanders.,In just his third pro start on Sunday, Sanders threw three touchdown passes, ran for a score and finished with 364 yards against Tennessee. He joined Joe Burrow as the only rookie QBs in league history with at least 350 yards passing, three TDs and a rushing TD in a game.,The performance became a footnote as the Browns came up short , to the two-win Titans and their rookie QB, Cam Ward.,Following the game, Sanders caught up on the field with Ward, last year's No. 1 pick who pressed him on his plans for the upcoming offseason.,Unlike Ward, Sanders can't afford to think that far ahead.,\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u0153This is my life here. So we on two different spectrums right now,\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u009d Sanders said. \\u00e2\\u20ac\\u009dI got to focus on playing my best and being the best player I can for the team. And obviously the situations are different. I know he puts his all into these games and these final four games, but it\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s just a little bit different because you don\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122t know what could happen.,\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u0153I just go here, enjoy my day, work hard, do everything I can. If I\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122m here, I\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122m here. If I\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122m not, I\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122m not. It\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s nothing in my control. I try to control what I can control \\u00e2\\u20ac\\u201d going out there, making the right reads. Going out there, doing the right things, being the person I am and things will fall how they\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122re supposed to.\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u009d,Things rarely go as planned in Cleveland, but Sanders is giving the Browns some hope in another rotten season.,He's shown significant improvement each game, whether connecting on a downfield throw or firing the ball out of bounds to avoid a sack.,That's not to say he's been perfect.,In the third quarter last week, Sanders, who since college has had a bad habit of holding the ball too long, tried to create something out of nothing. It cost him.,Scrambling to buy time after the protection broke down, Sanders forced a pass down the middle that was easily intercepted by the Titans. The turnover set up Tennessee's go-ahead score and set the stage for the Titan's win.,It was another tough lesson for Sanders, who said changing his ways isn't problematic.,\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u0153Not hard. It just took a little explaining,\\\" he said, flashing a knowing smile. \\\"It\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s a negative thing to happen for me to just slow down. I look at everything and I understand, OK, this is what I was trying to do, and in this situation, this that\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s what you should do.,\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u0153And sometimes it go your way, then they\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122ll be like, \\u00e2\\u20ac\\u02dcthat was lit\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122 and sometimes it don\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122t. So you got to limit those that wasn\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122t the best risk in certain situations, certain times of the game.\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u009d,This week presents another tough test for Sanders, who will face a Chicago defense leading the league with 18 interceptions.,Stefanski, whose future could hinge on how the Browns play in December, has been pleased with his QB's steady progress.,\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u0153In terms of a light turning on, those type of things, I just think he\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s committed to getting better every single week,\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u009d he said. \\\"And that\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s what you want.\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u009d,Notes: The temperature could be in the single digits in Chicago. Sanders is doing all he can not to think about the icy weather. \\u00e2\\u20ac\\u0153One thing you don\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122t want to be is mentally defeated before you get there,\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u009d he said. \\u00e2\\u20ac\\u0153Whatever comes with however it feels out there just comes with it.\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u009d ... Several starters missed practice, including CB Denzel Ward , S Grant Delpit , DT Mason Graham , TE David Njoku and WR Cedric Tillman . Stefanski ruled out RG Wyatt Teller for Sunday.\",\n          \"10 new cafes, restaurants, bakeries to try out in Delhi-NCR this winter                Winter is the season to pamper ourselves, and what better way to do that if not with good food and great vibes?

I\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122m thankful for it, but I\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122m not content with my situation with everything.\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u009d,The former Colorado star has come a long way since tumbling to the fifth round of this year's draft. The 23-year-old was fourth string throughout training camp and the preseason before two trades and rookie Dillon Gabriel's concussion catapulted Sanders.,In just his third pro start on Sunday, Sanders threw three touchdown passes, ran for a score and finished with 364 yards against Tennessee. He joined Joe Burrow as the only rookie QBs in league history with at least 350 yards passing, three TDs and a rushing TD in a game.,The performance became a footnote as the Browns came up short , to the two-win Titans and their rookie QB, Cam Ward.,Following the game, Sanders caught up on the field with Ward, last year's No. 1 pick who pressed him on his plans for the upcoming offseason.,Unlike Ward, Sanders can't afford to think that far ahead.,\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u0153This is my life here. So we on two different spectrums right now,\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u009d Sanders said. \\u00e2\\u20ac\\u009dI got to focus on playing my best and being the best player I can for the team. And obviously the situations are different. I know he puts his all into these games and these final four games, but it\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s just a little bit different because you don\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122t know what could happen.,\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u0153I just go here, enjoy my day, work hard, do everything I can. If I\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122m here, I\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122m here. If I\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122m not, I\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122m not. It\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s nothing in my control. I try to control what I can control \\u00e2\\u20ac\\u201d going out there, making the right reads. Going out there, doing the right things, being the person I am and things will fall how they\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122re supposed to.\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u009d,Things rarely go as planned in Cleveland, but Sanders is giving the Browns some hope in another rotten season.,He's shown significant improvement each game, whether connecting on a downfield throw or firing the ball out of bounds to avoid a sack.,That's not to say he's been perfect.,In the third quarter last week, Sanders, who since college has had a bad habit of holding the ball too long, tried to create something out of nothing. It cost him.,Scrambling to buy time after the protection broke down, Sanders forced a pass down the middle that was easily intercepted by the Titans. The turnover set up Tennessee's go-ahead score and set the stage for the Titan's win.,It was another tough lesson for Sanders, who said changing his ways isn't problematic.,\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u0153Not hard. It just took a little explaining,\\\" he said, flashing a knowing smile. \\\"It\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s a negative thing to happen for me to just slow down. I look at everything and I understand, OK, this is what I was trying to do, and in this situation, this that\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s what you should do.,\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u0153And sometimes it go your way, then they\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122ll be like, \\u00e2\\u20ac\\u02dcthat was lit\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122 and sometimes it don\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122t. So you got to limit those that wasn\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122t the best risk in certain situations, certain times of the game.\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u009d,This week presents another tough test for Sanders, who will face a Chicago defense leading the league with 18 interceptions.,Stefanski, whose future could hinge on how the Browns play in December, has been pleased with his QB's steady progress.,\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u0153In terms of a light turning on, those type of things, I just think he\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s committed to getting better every single week,\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u009d he said. \\\"And that\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s what you want.\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u009d,Notes: The temperature could be in the single digits in Chicago. Sanders is doing all he can not to think about the icy weather. \\u00e2\\u20ac\\u0153One thing you don\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122t want to be is mentally defeated before you get there,\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u009d he said. \\u00e2\\u20ac\\u0153Whatever comes with however it feels out there just comes with it.\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u009d ... Several starters missed practice, including CB Denzel Ward , S Grant Delpit , DT Mason Graham , TE David Njoku and WR Cedric Tillman .

              "'Did you know your nails can signal psoriasis? Doctor shares 5 changes in hands and nails indicating underlying disease Long before a health condition becomes obvious, the body often sends out quiet, easily overlooked signals that something isn t quite right. While some warning signs are well known, others can seem unusual or unrelated at first glance - making them harder to recognise or connect to an underlying illness. This is where awareness becomes powerful, especially when it comes to subtle changes in the hands and nails that can offer valuable clues about what s happening inside the body. Also Read Delhi cardiologist with 40 years experience shares 5 warning signs your heart is struggling silently Dr Kunal Sood, an anaesthesiologist and interventional pain medicine physician, has highlighted five key changes in the nails and hands that may signal underlying health issues - and in some cases, chronic conditions such as arthritis or psoriasis . In an Instagram video shared on December 9, the physician explains that recognising these subtle signs early can aid in identifying serious health conditions and support timely diagnosis and treatment. A post shared by Kunal Sood, MD doctorsoood According to Dr Kunal Sood, clubbing causes the fingertips to appear rounded with curved nails as the soft tissue enlarges - a physical change that can sometimes signal underlying lung or heart disease. He explains, It occurs when megakaryocytes bypass the lungs and release growth factors like VEGF and PDGF at the fingertips. It is linked to chronic lung disease lung cancer, bronchiectasis, pulmonary fibrosis, cystic fibrosis and heart conditions with long-term low oxygen such as cyanotic congenital heart disease or endocarditis. Koilonychia or spoon-shaped nails might be an early warning sign of iron deficiency anaemia. Dr Sood highlights, Koilonychia creates thin, concave nails due to impaired keratin formation when iron-dependent enzymes weaken. It often reflects iron deficiency from blood loss, heavy periods, low intake, malabsorption, or increased need in pregnancy. These nail changes can precede other symptoms for months. If you notice red streaks on your nails, Dr Sood states that it might be an indication of blood vessel inflammation. He explains, Splinter hemorrhages look like red-brown lines under the nails from ruptured capillaries. While trauma is common, multiple streaks or those near the nail base raise concern for systemic conditions such as vasculitis, lupus, connective-tissue disease, or infective endocarditis. Swollen joints on your fingers are a classic sign of arthritis. The physician points out, Swelling may reflect osteoarthritis from cartilage loss or inflammatory arthritis like rheumatoid or psoriatic arthritis involving synovial inflammation. Because trauma, gout or metabolic issues can mimic this finding, clinical exam and imaging help distinguish causes. According to Dr Sood, pitting in nails is a hallmark sign of nail-matrix involvement in psoriasis. He elaborates, About one-third of psoriasis patients show pits, and prevalence increases with disease duration. It may accompany discoloration, thickening or onycholysis and is common in psoriatic arthritis, making it a useful early clue.

shedeur sanders is keeping his focus on improving after a strong 3rd start is still learning to decipher nfl defenses, recognize coverages and make much smarter decisions.,he can already read the room.,the rookie quarterback's path to starting for the browns has been curious and circuitous, to say the least. but just because he's currently atop the depth chart, and will stay there the rest of this season, sanders isn't stationary or satisfied.,coming off , of his young career, leading to coach kevin stefanski naming him the starter for the final four games, sanders said before wednesday s practice he's not concerned with whether he has shown cleveland enough to end its long search for a franchise qb.,he's staying in the moment., that s not in my focus, sanders said. my focus right now is the team we re playing ahead, the bears. so anything past that i m not really focused on, honestly. i m thankful for it, but i m not content with my situation with everything. ,the former colorado star has come a long way since tumbling to the fifth round of this year's draft. the 23-year-old was fourth string throughout training camp and the preseason before two trades and rookie dillon gabriel's concussion catapulted sanders.,in just his third pro start on sunday, sanders threw three touchdown passes, ran for a score and finished with 364 yards against tennessee. he joined joe burrow as the only rookie qbs in league history with at least 350 yards passing, three tds and a rushing td in a game.,the performance became a footnote as the browns came up short , to the two-win titans and their rookie qb, cam ward.,following the game, sanders caught up on the field with ward, last year's no. 1 pick who pressed him on his plans for the upcoming offseason.,unlike ward, sanders can't afford to think that far ahead., this is my life here. so we on two different spectrums right now, sanders said. i got to focus on playing my best and being the best player i can for the team. and obviously the situations are different. i know he puts his all into these games and these final four games, but it s just a little bit different because you don t know what could happen., i just go here, enjoy my day, work hard, do everything i can. if i m here, i m here. if i m not, i m not. it s nothing in my control. i try to control what i can control going out there, making the right reads. going out there, doing the right things, being the person i am and things will fall how they re supposed to. ,things rarely go as planned in cleveland, but sanders is giving the browns some hope in another rotten season.,he's shown significant improvement each game, whether connecting on a downfield throw or firing the ball out of bounds to avoid a sack.,that's not to say he's been perfect.,in the third quarter last week, sanders, who since college has had a bad habit of holding the ball too long, tried to create something out of nothing. it cost him.,scrambling to buy time after the protection broke down, sanders forced a pass down the middle that was easily intercepted by the titans. the turnover set up tennessee's go-ahead score and set the stage for the titan's win.,it was another tough lesson for sanders, who said changing his ways isn't problematic., not hard. it just took a little explaining,\\\" he said, flashing a knowing smile. \\\"it s a negative thing to happen for me to just slow down. i look at everything and i understand, ok, this is what i was trying to do, and in this situation, this that s what you should do., and sometimes it go your way, then they ll be like, that was lit and sometimes it don t. so you got to limit those that wasn t the best risk in certain situations, certain times of the game. ,this week presents another tough test for sanders, who will face a chicago defense leading the league with 18 interceptions.,stefanski, whose future could hinge on how the browns play in december, has been pleased with his qb's steady progress., in terms of a light turning on, those type of things, i just think he s committed to getting better every single week, he said. \\\"and that s what you want. ,notes: the temperature could be in the single digits in chicago. sanders is doing all he can not to think about the icy weather. one thing you don t want to be is mentally defeated before you get there, he said. whatever comes with however it feels out there just comes with it. ... several starters missed practice, including cb denzel ward , s grant delpit , dt mason graham , te david njoku and wr cedric tillman . stefanski ruled out rg wyatt teller for sunday.\",\n          \"10 new cafes, restaurants, bakeries to try out in delhi-ncr this winter winter is the season to pamper ourselves, and what better way to
